# Achievement NFTs DApp on Aptos

## Project Vision
The *Achievement NFTs DApp* is a decentralized platform designed to reward students with *Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs)* for their academic achievements. Institutions can mint unique NFTs to celebrate milestones like course completion, honors, or top performance in exams. Built on the *Aptos blockchain, the system ensures secure and tamper-proof credentials, while the **React* frontend allows users to view and claim their achievements, with the *Petra wallet* facilitating authentication and transaction signing.

## Features
- *NFT Rewards for Academic Achievements*: Institutions can mint NFTs to reward students for their academic success.
- *Verifiable and Immutable Credentials*: Each achievement NFT is verifiable and stored securely on the blockchain.
- *React Frontend*: User-friendly interface for viewing and claiming achievement NFTs.
- *Aptos Move Smart Contracts*: Secure achievement handling using the Aptos Move language.
- *Petra Wallet Integration*: Users can authenticate and sign transactions via the Petra wallet.

## Tech Stack
- *Frontend*: React.js
- *Blockchain*: Aptos (Move Language)
- *Wallet*: Petra Wallet

## How It Works
1. *Mint Achievement NFTs*: Institutions can issue NFTs representing academic achievements.
2. *Store on Blockchain*: Achievements are stored on the Aptos blockchain, providing tamper-proof credentials.
3. *Verify Achievements*: NFTs can be verified for authenticity by checking the blockchain.
4. *Petra Wallet*: Use Petra Wallet to sign and confirm blockchain transactions.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/)
- [React](https://reactjs.org/)
- [Aptos CLI](https://aptos.dev/cli-tools/aptos-cli-tool/)
- [Petra Wallet](https://petra.app/)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/aptos-achievement-nfts.git
   cd aptos-achievement-nfts
   

2. Install frontend dependencies:
   bash
   npm install
   

3. Set up the Aptos environment:
   - Install Aptos CLI:  
     bash
     curl -sSf https://aptos.dev/cli-tools/install | sh
     
   - Create an Aptos account:
     bash
     aptos init
     
   - Fund the account using the Aptos faucet (Devnet):
     bash
     aptos account fund-with-faucet --account your_account_address
     

4. Deploy the Move smart contract:
   - Navigate to the move folder in your project.
   - Build and deploy the contract:
     bash
     aptos move compile
     aptos move publish --profile devnet
     

5. Run the React frontend:
   bash
   npm start
   

6. Ensure *Petra Wallet* is installed and connected to interact with the DApp.

### Deployment

1. *Deploy on Aptos Devnet/Testnet*:
   - *Build the Move contract*:
     bash
     aptos move compile
     
   - *Deploy the contract*:
     bash
     aptos move publish --profile devnet
     
   - The contract will be deployed on Aptos Devnet/Testnet. Make sure to copy the contract address for frontend integration.
   
2. *Frontend Deployment*:
   - Deploy the React app using any preferred service (e.g., Netlify, Vercel).
   - Update the contract address and Aptos network configurations in the frontend code.

### Usage
- Go to the frontend URL (e.g., http://localhost:3000 or deployed link).
- Connect your *Petra Wallet*.
- Institutions can issue achievement NFTs, and students can view and claim their NFTs representing academic success.
